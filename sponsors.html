      <h2>Why sponsor the Optical Biology Conference?</h2>
      <p>
        The Optical Biology Conference is a small, student-led, international retreat focused on optical imaging, microscopy and quantitative biology.
        It brings together early-career researchers (PhD students and postdocs), technical facility leads and group leaders for two days of science and one day of local visits and industry engagement.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Targeted & high-quality exposure</strong> — intimate format (≈60–100 attendees) ensures long, substantive conversations at poster sessions, coffee breaks and demos.</li>
        <li><strong>International attendees & top institutes</strong> — participants and hosts from across Europe and beyond, including UCL (UK), VIB–KU Leuven (Belgium), and NTNU / Kavli (Norway).</li>
        <li><strong>Early-career talent pipeline</strong> — meet skilled PhD students in optics, imaging and computation, who are strong candidates for future technical and research roles.</li>
        <li><strong>Skills & capacity building</strong> — sponsoring helps fund student organisation, professional development and travel bursaries that strengthen the next generation of imaging scientists.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible engagement</strong> — financial support, student bursaries, poster prizes, or bespoke activities tailored to your goals.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparent follow-up</strong> — post-event sponsor report summarising attendance, visibility, and impact metrics.</li>
      </ul>
